When creating a new gist in GitHub, 

first install Gist Extension by Ken Howard

then, when coding and you have a new code snippet

send the code to a new file in my gists folder 

Powershell commands for file and adding content 'New-Item' path{filename}, 'Add-Content' path content 

It's a lot better if I just use the 'Add-Content' with path{filename} and the content between the " ...... " 

click command Ctrl+Shift+P

enter create block, and then name and password 

then follow the prompt ... 


and boom your gist is online!
