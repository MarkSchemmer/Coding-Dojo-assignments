Hello I'm Mark James Schemmer;

I started coding in July 21st of 2016.

I still remember the day. I love codewars.com, and other online coding sites, such as 'Code Review' and project Euler.
I hope to become a 1Dan warrior on codewars.com in all my languages such as Js, C#, F#, Python, SQL, and I hope to start Ruby soon.

As well I hope to get through the Coding Dojo and get a Job, attend Hackathons, and even join a chess club.
Most of all grow into the community of the Pacific Northwest!

My favorite hobbies are:
        hiking, Codwars. 
        
My dream is one day to learn piano and go to school for mathematics.

I lived in South America for many years during my time there I learned Spanish
and best of all I married a wonderful Latina, and yes, she is very spicy.

I have a passion for coding but most all the best feeling is helping my fellow classmates Improve and sharing all the knowledge I have with them.


My favorite movie is: Berzerk, it's a three part anime series. The main character is Guts, he's my favorite character.
I want to do the same in this course! go Berzerk(well on code)!

and now I'm going to add a favorite book: "We Can Do" it's by Moshe Kai Calvan, He is a Chinease American 
Moshe is my Hero! 

He believes that through hard work anybody can reach the stars! 

I hope you read the book!
