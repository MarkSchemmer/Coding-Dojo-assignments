                            <p>Computers connnected to the Web are called clients and servers.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clients are the typical Web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected 
                                to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and Web-accessing software available 
                                on those devices (ussually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                                <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a 
                                , a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be 
                                displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on.</li>
                                <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
                                <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the clients a "200 OK" message, which 
                                means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser 
                                as a series of small chunks.</li>
                                <li>The Browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>

                    <p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that 
                    they serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript!</p>
